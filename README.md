These results show that the change of coach or dismissal of Shin Tae-Yong gave a mixed response from the public as indicated by a small difference between positive and negative responses (not dominated by one sentiment). Positive sentiment is the sentiment with the most opinions obtained from the public's positive response in the form of thanks to Shin Tae-Yong for his services in bringing the national team to its current level. Negative sentiment is obtained from opinion which is dominated by expressions of public disappointment with the policies taken and rumors of new coaching.

Based on the word cloud, the words “Shin Tae Yong” and “Indonesia National Team” are the most dominant words that show great attention to Shin Tae-Yong's coaching of the Indonesian national team. Then, the words “Erick Tohir” and “PSSI” are also words that often appear in opinions. This shows that Erick Tohir as the chairman of PSSI and PSSI as the Indonesian football federation became the center of attention of the policy he took in making a coaching change. Furthermore, the word “World Cup” is also dominant in opinion which shows public attention to the policy of changing coaches made in the midst of world cup qualifications. In addition, the word “Patrick Kluivert” is also one of the most dominant which shows public attention to one of the names rumored to replace Shin Tae-Yong.
